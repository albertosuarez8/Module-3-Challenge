# Password Generator

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to further apply my Javascript skills. This project allowed me to create functionally to a website. This website can now be used by the public to generate a password of selected criteria of their choosing. It can create complex passwords for users to have added security to their password protected log-ins. I learned how to apply js array methods, create functions, and use my research skills to my fullest extent.
